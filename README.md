# 👋 Hello, I'm Merve (Elrevmore)

🚀 **Bio**  
I’m a **career-switcher into Data Science**, currently learning in public and building my skills step by step through real projects. With a background in biology, I bring strong analytical thinking and curiosity into **Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning**.

I focus on learning by doing: writing code, breaking things, fixing them, and documenting the process. I’m especially interested in collaborative projects where I can grow, contribute, and learn from others.

---

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Doing

* Working on **end-to-end data analysis projects** using real-world datasets
* Improving **SQL + Pandas** workflows for data extraction and analysis
* Practicing **data storytelling** through visualizations and dashboards
* Learning by refining projects: cleaning code, improving README files, and documenting insights
* Preparing a stronger **portfolio for data / analytics roles**
