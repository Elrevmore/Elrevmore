# 👋 Hello, I'm Merve (Elrevmore)

🚀 **Bio**
I’m a **career‑switcher into Data Science**, currently learning in public and building my skills step by step through real projects. With a background in biology, I bring strong analytical thinking and curiosity into **Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning**.

I focus on learning by doing: writing code, breaking things, fixing them, and documenting the process. I’m especially interested in collaborative projects where I can grow, contribute, and learn from others.

---

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Doing

* Strengthening my Python fundamentals (CS50P)
* Practicing data analysis with real datasets
* Building small but solid projects to improve problem‑solving skills
* Learning Git & collaborative workflows
